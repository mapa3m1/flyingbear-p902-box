Hello everybody! 
You have 2 files, windows and box. 
Box - plywood 5mm by laser cutting, please save inner parts. But i used 6 mm.
Windows - any plastic wich you like, i prefer translucent Acrylic 4 mm  . 4 parts - 2 doors (280x280mm & 310x310mm) & 2 windows (300x300mm), also laser cuttint. 
280x280 for top side
300x300 for right and left sides
310x310 for front side
Rear side ( with big Rectangular hole ) - use inner side for rear cover, It is necessary to glue big part with 20x465 & 20x365. 13 mm holes for cabeles.

Maybe you must use your hands to make it better ))))
